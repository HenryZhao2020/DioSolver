# LDE Solver

While taking MATH 135 at the University of Waterloo, I became fascinated by linear Diophantine equations (ax + by = c). I wanted to create a tool to simplify learning, guide students through each step, and help verify solutions.

After some coding, I developed a utility that does just that! It works by:

1️⃣ Inputting values for a, b, and c, along with the domains of x and y.

2️⃣ Guiding users through solving the equation:
• Calculating the GCD using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
• Finding a particular solution.
• Deriving the full solution set.

Built with a C core and a Qt (C++) interface, it’s intuitive, student-friendly, and designed for learning, teaching, or exploration. A version written in Racket is also available.
